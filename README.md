# MTA-Station-Geo-Location-Mapping
CSV file that maps MTA station names from the [MTA turnstile datasets](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) to their corresponding geo-location.

There's also a Jupyter notebook explaining the process. 

###### Note:
I found that others have done this as well. You can find their dataset [here](https://github.com/chriswhong/nycturnstiles/blob/master/geocoded.csv)
There's also a repository with cleaned daily exits/enter counts for each station with their respective geographical location [here.](https://qri.cloud/nyc-transit-data/turnstile_daily_counts_2020)
You might need to make an account though. I haven't tried it so I'm not sure.
